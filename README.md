Maybe you will face the problem of uploading your assembly code into the Arduino Uno (Atmega328p uc) board using Atmel studio 7. I provide with simple steps to do so. Go to the "releases" section here and follow the steps. Good Luck!

NB: This procedure is a shortcut. Instead of going the Arduino ide to look for the avrdude.exe file's path, I provide you directly with the path and the command so you just copy and paste in the right fields (don't forget to replace your PC name on the path).
Any Questions, feel free to ask!
